Portfolio Website
=

Hi guys, this is my portfolio website which was set as a project for my codecademy.com full stack development course.
The features I'm most proud of are:
+ Nightmode Button
+ Resizing for different devices

I used HTML to write the elements, CSS for the styling and resizing functionality, and a little bit javacript for the nightmode button.

I'd love to hear any suggestions for improvements. :)
